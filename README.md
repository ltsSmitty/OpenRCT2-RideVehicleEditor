# Wet Paint â€“ Dynamic Track Colouration for OpenRCT2

Your ride vehicles are dripping with paint, covering the tracks with paint as they roll over them!

### Current features
- Paint the tracks under a ride with up to three different colour themes.

## How to use it
1. Open the plugin and select a ride from the dropdown or pick one with the eyedropper, and enable colour matching.
2. In the ride's paint window, change the ride colour mode to `Different colours per train`.
3. Set the individual train cars to the colours you want:
  - The first train colour becomes the main track colour
  - The second train colour becomes the secondary track colour
  - The third colour becomes the track support colour
4. **If your ride has more than 3 trains**, you'll need to set the multiples of three trains to have the same colours. E.g., you'll need to manually set
* `Train 1` & `Train 4` & `Train 7` to have the same colours, and
* `Train 2` & `Train 5` & `Train 8` to match, and
* `Train 3` & `Train 6` & `Train 9` to matchm etc.

### FAQ
- The plugin uses the `Alternative track colour schemes` for setting the track colours, which is what limits to using only 3 different paint schemes.


### Potential improvments
- Automatically change the 4th + more trains to automatically match the colours of the associated 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.
- Modify vehicle train colours directly inside the plugin window.
- Various performance improvements

## Installation

1. This plugin requires at least OpenRCT2 version v0.3.3 (release) or the newest develop version.
2. Download the latest version of the plugin from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Basssiiie/OpenRCT2-RideVehicleEditor/releases).
3. To install it, put the downloaded `*.js` file into your `/OpenRCT2/plugin` folder.
    - Easiest way to find the OpenRCT2-folder is by launching the OpenRCT2 game, click and hold on the red toolbox in the main menu, and select "Open custom content folder".
    - Otherwise this folder is commonly found in `C:/Users/<YOUR NAME>/Documents/OpenRCT2/plugin` on Windows.
    - If you already had this plugin installed before, you can safely overwrite the old file.
4. Once the file is there, it should show up ingame in the dropdown menu under the map icon.

###  Is it safe to uninstall the plugin if I don't want it anymore?
**Answer:** yes, uninstalling the plugin (by removing it from the Plugins folder) does not break your game or save files.

## Building the source code

This project is based on [wisnia74's Typescript modding template](https://github.com/wisnia74/openrct2-typescript-mod-template) and uses [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) from this template.

1. Install latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and make sure to include NPM in the installation options.
2. Clone the project to a location of your choice on your PC.
3. Open command prompt, use `cd` to change your current directory to the root folder of this project and run `npm install`.
4. Find `openrct2.d.ts` TypeScript API declaration file in OpenRCT2 files and copy it to `lib` folder (this file can usually be found in `C:/Users/<YOUR NAME>/Documents/OpenRCT2/bin/` or `C:/Program Files/OpenRCT2/`).
    - Alternatively, you can make a symbolic link instead of copying the file, which will keep the file up to date whenever you install new versions of OpenRCT2.
5. Run `npm run build` (release build) or `npm run build:dev` (develop build) to build the project.
    - The default output folder is `(project directory)/dist` and can be changed in `rollup.config.prod.js` and `rollup.config.dev.js` respectively.

### Hot reload

This project supports the [OpenRCT2 hot reload feature](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/blob/master/distribution/scripting.md#writing-scripts) for development.

1. Make sure you've enabled it by setting `enable_hot_reloading = true` in your `/OpenRCT2/config.ini`.
2. Open `rollup.config.dev.js` and change the output file path to your plugin folder.
    - Example: `C:/Users/<YOUR NAME>/Documents/OpenRCT2/plugin/RideVehicleEditor.js`.
    - Make sure this path uses `/` instead of `\` slashes!
3. Open command prompt and use `cd` to change your current directory to the root folder of this project.
4. Run `npm start` to start the hot reload server.
5. Use the `/OpenRCT2/bin/openrct2.com` executable to [start OpenRCT2 with console](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/blob/master/distribution/scripting.md#writing-scripts) and load a save or start new game.
6. Each time you save any of the files in `./src/`, the server will compile `./src/registerPlugin.ts` and place compiled plugin file inside your local OpenRCT2 plugin directory.
7. OpenRCT2 will notice file changes and it will reload the plugin.
